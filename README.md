## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Michigan with experience in full-stack development, AI/ML agents and workflows, and C++ programming.

Currently, I'm focused on integrating intelligent agents into real-world full-stack applications. I'm also exploring the intersection of software and financial markets by experimenting with Polymarketâ€™s API and building tools around market data and prediction systems.

I'm particularly interested in roles in Software Engineering, Quantitative Development, or Quantitative Trading.
